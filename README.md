------------------------------

[This repository](https://github.com/tcllab/tcc4tcl) is a fork made in an 
effort to combine multiple independent contributions to the project and to 
upgrade the [tinycc compiler](https://github.com/TinyCC/tinycc) used (0.9.26, 
released 2013) to the latest release (0.9.27, released 2017)

This repository was forked from [cyanolgivie's 
fork](https://github.com/cyanogilvie/tcc4tcl) of rkeene's repository.

A branch called "tcllab" was created from the commit representing the last 
official release (tcc4tcl 0.30) made by rkeene.

To the "tcllab" branch have been added enhancements contributed by 
[MichaelMiR01](https://github.com/MichaelMiR01/tcc4tcl).

Another branch called "upgrade_tcc_0_9_27" was created from the last official 
release commit to carry out the upgrade to tinycc 0.9.27.

The plan is to merge all enhancements committed by rkeene, cyanogilvie, 
MichaelMiR01 and tcllab into the "tcllab" branch,  which will then be merged 
into the "master" branch as a new release.
